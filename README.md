# Everyone is John

### A competitive roleplaying game for three or more people.
 
## Author's Notes

This is a fork from [rtwolf](https://www.github.com/rtwolf). Changes made are a reflavoring away from distasteful texts of the original work (reflavoring John as a mecha instead of a person with DID and such; i get it, it's an older game, but I like the idea and you can make it fun and zany without being ableist or transphobic).

Everyone is John has, quite to my surprise, developed a small but devoted following over the years. I've made it available again here principally to advertise the fact that I've released it under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which basically allows anyone to copy and alter and remix it. But, appropriately enough, the premiere site for _Everyone is John_ is probably [http://www.everyoneisjohn.com](http://www.everyoneisjohn.com/). I do not control that site, am not affiliated with that site, and do not endorse everything on that site, but I am pleased that people like my game enough to have broadcast it during the time that my webpage was down.

So, basically, if you want the canonical text, here it is. If you're looking for Everyone is John resources, got to [http://www.everyoneisjohn.com](http://www.everyoneisjohn.com/) or just Google it, and you'll find lots of stuff. Thanks!



## The Game Itself

_Everyone is John_ is a humorous, competitive roleplaying game about playing the various aliens inside John, a human-shaped mech masquerading around as a kooky man from Minneapolis. One participant is the GM, or, in Everyone is John lingo, "Everyone Else." All of the other players are aliens in John's head.

Everyone is John uses six-sided dice (you really only need one, but it might be easiest if every participant carries one) for play.

### Aliens

Aliens are the Player Characters of Everyone is John. They are defined by a simple character sheet:

- Willpower - A pool of points that the Alien can spend to take control of John or improve its chance of success in any given action. Willpower will go down and up a lot in the game, so it might be easier to represent it with tokens rather than numbers on a page. Willpower starts off at 10 for most Aliens.
- Skills - Each Alien has two or three skills. This is a freeform game, so just write down a short description of the skill, like "Drives well," or "Good at persuading people." Most Aliens have two skills, but you can have three if you start at 7 Willpower instead of 10.
- Obsession - This is kind of like a winning condition: if you complete your obsession more than other Aliens complete their obsession, you win. Obsessions come in three grades: Level 1 (pretty easy to accomplish, like "Pigging out on candy"), Level 2 (more difficult or risky, like, "dressing up as a turkey and running through the lion enclosure,"), and Level 3 (nearly impossible to accomplish, like, "Blowing up buildings"). The harder obsessions count more than the easier ones.

If you're going to seriously compete with the other Aliens, you probably should keep your sheet a secret.

### John

John is a mobile tactical platform masquerading as a kooky man in Minneapolis. It is controlled by the Aliens in its head — one at a time, of course.

John is not terribly competent; it has difficulty with a lot of things that you and I might take for granted. Whenever John attempts anything that an ordinary person might have any chance of failure at, it needs to roll for success.

The Alien who is currently in control of John does the rolling. If that Alien has a skill that covers the challenge, the Alien needs to roll a 3 or higher on the single d6\. If it doesn't have a skill, it needs to roll a 6\. However, before the roll, the Alien can spend any number of Willpower points to get a +1 per point spent on the die roll. This can make success automatic.

Becoming the active Alien is a bit of a challenge, though. Whenever John wakes up or gets hurt, a test for control of John happens. Also, whenever the currently active Alien fails a roll or completes its obsession, a test for control of John happens.

When a test for control of John occurs, all of the Aliens who are interested simultaneously bid one or more Willpower points (if you're using tokens for Willpower, it's easiest for everyone to just hold out the tokens in their closed hands, and then, when everyone's ready, reveal the number of tokens). Aliens don't have to bid if they don't want to (and you can hold out zero tokens if you want to fake out the other Aliens). The highest number of Willpower becomes the active Alien. If multiple people bid the same highest amount, then they roll off to see who becomes active.

The Alien who becomes active loses the amount of Willpower it bids. All others keep their bids. It's perfectly acceptible for the previously active Alien to win a bid and remain active.

Whenever John wakes up, the struggle for control of John happens before the GM describes the situation John wakes up into.

John is pretty easily distracted. Whenever nothing exciting is happening for ten minutes or more (such as on a bus ride or the like), the GM should roll a die. On a roll of 4 or higher, John goes into stand-by and boots back up whenever (prompting a struggle for control of John). When John "naps" like this, all of the Aliens gain one Willpower.

### Playing

Play begins with John waking up in the morning (and a test for control of it). The GM then describes the circumstances into which it wakes up. With John, you never can tell. It could be in a gutter somewhere, or it could be in a palatial estate, or anywhere in between. The Aliens really have no idea how they ended up here.

At this point, the Aliens should start working on fulfilling their obsessions and avoiding getting John killed. Inevitably, their Willpowers will decrease. Once all of the Aliens are out of Willpower, John sinks back into stand-by, and the game session is over.

At this point, the Aliens reveal their obsessions and count up how many times each was filled. Note that it counts for you if someone else is Active and fulfills your obsession.

Now, multiply the number of times you fulfilled your obsession by your obsession's rank (1, 2, or 3). That's the number of points you have. Highest number of points wins the game, and, generally speaking, is the GM of the next game of Everyone is John.
